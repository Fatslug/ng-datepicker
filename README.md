# Datepicker

Project built with @angular/cli beta.31

## How to use
Inside this repo is a folder `src/app/datepicker` - this is the datepicker component.
After selecting a date, an event is emitted to the parent component of the datepicker which contains a full date object, ready for formatting however you'd like.
